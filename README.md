# Word Cloud Layout iOS

This is a [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/)-inspired word cloud layout written
in JavaScript. It uses HTML5 canvas and sprite masks to achieve
near-interactive speeds hosted in UIWebView in iOS, along with the original 
project.

See [here](http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) for an interactive
demonstration along with implementation details of the original code.
